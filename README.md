## Shades

Welcome to shades, Netflix Partner Platform's entity relationship service.

Modern web applications are composed of micro-services with different data sources. One problem with this architecture is mapping the relationships between the various entities that are modeled in those data sources. For relationships that span multiple levels, or for bi-directional traversal, this problem becomes even more difficult.

Common solutions, such as Spark, are big data tools that are language specific or rely only on a tabular view.
 
Our proposed solution: Entity Relationship Manager

A distributed, modular middleware service that can pull data from a variety of sources, transform it into any kind of projection, and handle queries on those projections. This single service can be used to generate hierarchical relationships (trees), graphs, table views, and so on.

We will be working on the core service, building pluggable modules to extend support for new data sources and pipelines, and adding new projections.

### The team

The Partner Platform Apps team is part of the Partner Device Ecosystem organization. The organization works with partners like Sony, LG, Broadcom, Comcast, and many others to implement the Netflix SDK onto their devices. The Partner Platform Apps team builds applications and services that are used by external partners and internal teams to scale these activities.
 
We make it possible to implement Netflix on more devices every year.
